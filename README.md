# TrollDJ
A fork of Troll Engine, adding support for turntable gameplay _Ã  la DJ Hero_.

## How can I play what this fork adds?
You'd need both a DJ Hero turntable.

### For Wii DJ Hero controllers...
You'd need [a Raphnet adapter](https://www.raphnet-tech.com/products/wusbmote_1player_adapter_v3/index.php) for best functionality.  
Alternatively, you can use [the turntable-compatible fork of WiitarThing by _TheNathannator_](https://github.com/TheNathannator/WiitarThing/releases/tag/v2.7.0.5), but do expect jank.

### For other kinds of DJ Hero controllers...
It _should_ work just-as.  
_Keyword: "should"._
